# Zombie-Game

The Zombie Game is all about exploring the office and collecting various resources from different areas. While inspecting those areas, the player has a chance to either encounter one of the zombies or find crafting resources. 
With those, the player can craft various weapons, armours, or healing items to survive. The game includes an XP system, where if a zombie is defeated, the player gains XP. With that, 
they can unlock more crafting recipes to have a higher chance of survival.  

 
Instructions:

- From the Main Menu, you can type ‘continue’ to start up the game. However, if you press ‘Start Game’, it erases your previous files and starts from the beginning. 

- At the start of the game, you start off with nothing, but if you encounter a zombie, you can type out ‘slap’ to hit the zombie and deal 5 damage to it. 

- Now type either ‘Area 1’ or ‘Area 2’ to search for resources but be careful because you can encounter one of the zombies. If you defeat one, each zombie will drop 12 XP. But if you get eliminated, you will be able
to continue from where you left off.

- After searching for areas, you will see new resources in your inventory. If you type out ‘Crafting table’, you will see your collected XP and items you have collected.
